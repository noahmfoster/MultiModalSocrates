# Multimodal Models
## Noah Foster
The bulk of the code is in the jupyter notebook called Multimodal Learning.
Submission.pdf has a lot of writing in it. 
The coolest part is definitely LiMBeRModel.py
The simplest is FlickrEval.py
For anyone interested, I have some self-contained environments for the daring. 
Good Luck.
